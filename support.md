# Getting help and support
{: #gettinghelp}

When you have problems while you are working with {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}, consider these options for getting help.
{: shortdesc}

You can get help by searching for information or by asking questions through a forum. You can also open a support ticket. When you are using the forums to ask a question, tag your question so that it is seen by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development teams.

  * If you have technical questions on Push Notifications, post your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-mobile-services) and tag your question with `ibm-push-notification`.
  * For questions about the service and getting started instructions, use the [IBM developerWorks](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/bluemix-mobile-services/) forum. Include the `push-notification` tag.

For more information about getting support, see [How do I get the support that I need?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support#getting-customer-support).
