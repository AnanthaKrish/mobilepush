# Overview for developers
{: #developer-overview}

You can access the capabilities of the Push Notifications service via a HTTP Representational State Transfer (ReST) APIs (application program interface). Platform specific Software Development Kits (SDKs) are also available to simplify application development.

 - Push Configuration
 - Device registrations
 - Messages
 - Subscriptions

The Push Notifications Service supports Android, iOS, Cordova and Web SDKs for simplified application development. [Install and integrate](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/mobilepush?topic=mobile-pushnotification-install-sdk) the SDK into your app. 

All SDKs support authenticating by using either your service credentials or an authentication token.
