# Step 1: Creating an IBM Cloud {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service instance
{: #push_step_1a}

You need to create an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

To create a Push Notifications service from the Catalog, complete the following steps:

1. In the IBM Cloud Catalog, click **Mobile** > **Push Notifications**.
2. Provide a Service name. 
3. Click **Create**. 

You can choose to create either a bound service or an unbound service. Bound services are connected to other IBM Cloud apps, while unbound apps are standalone and not connected to other apps. Push Notifications service apps are unbound by default.

You can use any of the following options to create a bound or unbound service:

- By creating an IBM Cloud application using the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate from the catalog. This creates a Push Notifications service bound to an IBM Cloud back-end application.
- By creating an unbound Push Notifications service directly from the Mobile catalog. You can later bind to an application or even choose to use it unbound. 
- By using the [IBM Cloud Catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/){: new_window}.

Your next step is to [obtain notification provider credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/mobilepush?topic=mobile-pushnotification-push_step_1).
